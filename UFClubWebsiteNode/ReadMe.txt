This is a test project for node. If node and express are installed, the project can be run using "node app.js" in a command window. The resulting website can be accessed at localhost:3000.

There are three subdirectories for testing:

localhost:3000/ (Here is the home page)
localhost:3000/calendar (An extremely low-resolution PNG of a calendar)
localhost:3000/main (A loaded html file)

This will be more functional once we have a clearer project structure.
