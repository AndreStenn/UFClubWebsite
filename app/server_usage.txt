This is a test project for node. If node and express are installed, the project can be run using "node server.js" in a command window. The resulting website can be accessed at localhost:3000.

There are four subdirectories for testing:

localhost:8080/ (Here is the home page)
localhost:8080/calendar (An extremely low-resolution PNG of a calendar)
localhost:8080/calendar/current (example event data)
localhost:8080/main (Delivers React app script)
localhost:8080/data (Queries a locally hosted MySql database)
